# Terms of partnership

## Who are formal partners?
Formal partners of the DSX are community intermediaries and points of contact for organizations, networks, and individuals looking for digital security training assistance and capacity. They act as connectors and verifiers as they bring  organizational leaders, organizers, and technologists to the exchange platform. 

In addition, formal partners collaborate to verify and vet incoming capacity building volunteers, ensuring that only trainers with a high degree of technical knowledge and cultural sensitivity are connected to those seeking assistance. 

To be a formal partner, you must be one of the following: 

- A movement or technology organization working with or within frontline communities, including but not limited to African American, South Asian, Muslim American, Latino, immigrant, refugee, LGBTQ, women’s rights, Native American, journalist, religious minority, and other communities; 
- Cohorts and networks of loosely-connected individuals working within and on behalf of these communities; 
- Individual technology experts, capacity builders, or movement leaders with deep connections to either tech communities or frontline communities.
